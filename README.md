# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

Pewlett Hackard is a large company and is looking to go through its employee pool to see who is near retirement age. The company is looking to distribute retirement packages to those who are eligible to receive and is also looking ahead to see what positions the company will need to fill after employee retirement. Pewlett Hackard assigned its research team to identify the following questions:

 1. Who will be retiring in the next couple of years?
 2. What positions will need to be filled?
 3. What is the number of employees retiring per title? 
 4. What employees are eligible to participate in a mentorship program?  
 
The purpose of the project is to build a SQL database to extract employee retirement data through queries in order to help Pewlett Hackard answer their questions to prepare for the future retirement period. 


## Results

### Deliverable 1: 
 
After creating the SQL employee database, a retirement table was created which held all of the active Pewlett Hackard employees who are near or at retirement age, born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. A unique title table was then created to identify the titles of the employees who are in the retirement age range. After, another table was created to count the number of employees in the retirement age range by job title. After the queries were created, the following conclusions were made about employees in the retirement age range: 

1. There are 133,776 Pewlett Hackard employees who fall in between the retirement age range. 

2. The job title with the most employees in the retirement age range are Senior Engineer with 29,414 retirement age employees followed by Senior Staff with 28,254 employees and Engineer with 14,222 employees. 

3. The positions that Pewlett Hackard will need to fill are the following:
      - Senior Engineer (29,414 retiring employees)
      - Senior Staff (28,254 retiring employees)
      - Engineer (14,222 retiring employees)
      - Staff (12,243 retiring employees)
      - Technique leader (4,502 retiring employees)
      - Assistant Engineer (1,761 retiring employees)
      - Manager (2 retiring employees)

### Deliverable 2:

Pewlett Hackard wished to identify which employees would qualify for mentorship eligibility. The requirement for the mentorship program are those born within the year of 1965. After creating a table to hold all of the eligible employees, the following result was provided: 

1. There are 1,941 employees born in the year of 1965 that are eligible for the mentroship program. 


## Summary

As the "silver tsuanmi" begins to take effect at Pewlett Hackard, it is extremely vital to understand the amount of rolls that need to be filled within the company and start preparing a recruitment strategy to hire new employees. There are 133,776 current employees who fall in between the retirement age range. I believe Pewlett Hackard should focus on finding replacements for the employees who are the closest to retirement age which would be those born between 1952 and 1953. Filling those positions first would provide Pewett Hackard with a safety net that will allow more time to finish the hiring proccess to replace those born in 1954 and 1955. Hiring new employees in rounds would not overwhelm the HR team with hiring all 133,776 employees at once and also would not overwhelm the mentors in the mentorship program, as there are only 1,941 employees that are eligible to mentor. I would also suggest that the mentorship program expand its age range and also include those who are born in 1966 and 1967 to mentor as well. In the event that Pewlett Hackard did have to onboard all of the new employees at once, it would provide a cushion for the mentors and ensure that all of the new employees will be properly trained.
